# Day 2 of Intro to Programming Class

### General Takeaways

I may be a better programmer than I thought, despite usually working with a GDD approach.

### Data Types

Most of the data type information was review for me as C# data types are easily comparable to Java data types. The few things I didn't know about data types (such as the var declaration) I had already been exposed to during assignments since I was hired. 

### Testing

I still am somewhat unclear on the exact qualifications for a test to be considered a unit test. I recognize there is specific criteria for the distinction, however, I'm confident I will be able to write basic tests covering edge cases and pick up any unusual behavior from any application I write, making this distinction seem to me somewhat arbitrary. This could be a dangerous assumption and I will continue to look into the difference. 

Test driven development as a concept I understand but I don't love the idea of writing tests before any code. I'm witholding judgement until we dive deeper and I see more examples tomorrow. 

### Code Snippet

No code snippet for today. I only post a code snippet if I've played with the code a little myself; I understood nearly everything today and therefore didn't write any unique code.
